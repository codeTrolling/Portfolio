## My portfolio
My personal portfolio website to demonstrate my skills, talk about myself and walk you through my learning journey.

This website will contain some information about myself (my profile), pictures or demos of my projects as well as some of the difficulties I faced in the process of creating them.

I will also walk you through my learning process (which language I started with, how I studied, how I evolved etc.)

## How to run this website: 
You need to have Node.js installed to run this.

If you have it installed, go to the project's folder and type ```npm i``` or ```npm install```. This should install all the dependencies needed for this app to run.

This portfolio is created using React.js. In order to run it after you have installed all the dependencies, you need to open up a terminal and go into the folder you have saved this project in and type: ```npm start```
This will run a server at port 3000 and open up your browser. Might take a little bit of time.

Sample: Let's say your path is: C:\codeTrolling\Portfolio
 
 *text that looks like ```this``` is the commands you should put in.* 

C:\> ```cd codeTrolling\Portfolio```

C:\codeTrolling\Portfolio> ```npm start```

Alternatively, you can go to said path through the file browser and type cmd in the path field at the top (when using Windows) which lets you skip the first command so that you only need to put in ```npm start```:
C:\codeTrolling\Portfolio> ```npm start```
